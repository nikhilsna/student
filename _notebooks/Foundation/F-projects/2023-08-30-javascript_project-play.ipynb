    "We will not just play the game, but *learn the design concepts behind it*, how the code is organized, and why OOP is powerful for games and larger software projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson combines:\n",
    "- **Teaching text** to explain programming ideas step by step.\n",
    "- **Code examples** in JavaScript.\n",
    "- **FRQ-style practice** scattered throughout to simulate AP CSP exam thinking.\n",
    "- **Connections to Big Ideas** (abstraction, data, algorithms, impact)."

    "##  The Whack-a-Mole Concept\n",
    "In Whack-a-Mole, the computer manages a grid of *holes*. Randomly, a mole (or sometimes a power-up) appears in a hole. The player must click or tap the mole before it disappears.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Rules:\n",
    "- **Moles** give points when clicked.\n",
    "- **Power-ups** may give bonus points or extra time.\n",
    "- The game tracks **score** and saves the **high score** using local storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "This simple idea is perfect for studying OOP: each part of the game (holes, moles, power-ups, score) can be represented as an **object**."

    "- **`Entity`** (abstract base class) → shared logic for anything that appears in a hole.\n",

    "- **`PowerUp`** → another type of `Entity`.\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 This is an example of **inheritance**: both `Mole` and `PowerUp` inherit from `Entity`.\n",
